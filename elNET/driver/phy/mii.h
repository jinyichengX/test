Register Bit Type                      Register Bit Description
 Notation 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 R                                  Read: A register or bit with this attribute can be read.
 W                                  Read: A register or bit with this attribute can be written.
 RO                                 Read only: Read only. Writes have no effect.
 WO                                 Write only: If a register or bit is write-only, reads will return unspecified data.
 WC                                 Write One to Clear: writing a one clears the value. Writing a zero has no effect
 WAC                                Write Anything to Clear: writing anything clears the value.
 RC                                 Read to Clear: Contents is cleared after the read. Writes have no effect.
 LL                                 Latch Low: Clear on read of register.
 LH                                 Latch High: Clear on read of register.
 SC                                 Self-Clearing: Contents are self-cleared after the being set. Writes of zero have no effect. Contents can be read.
 SS                                 Self-Setting: Contents are self-setting after being cleared. Writes of one have no effect. Contents can be read.
 RO/LH                              Read Only, Latch High: Bits with this attribute will stay high until the bit is read. After it 
                                    is read, the bit will either remain high if the high condition remains, or will go low if the 
                                    high condition has been removed. If the bit has not been read, the bit will remain high 
                                    regardless of a change to the high condition. This mode is used in some Ethernet PHY registers.
 NASR                               Not Affected by Software Reset. The state of NASR bits do not change on assertion of a software reset.
 RESERVED                           Reserved Field: Reserved fields must be written with zeros to ensure future compati
                                    bility. The value of reserved bits is not guaranteed on a read.
